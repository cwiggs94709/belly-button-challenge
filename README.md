# belly-button-challenge

This project focuses on creating interactive visualizations using the D3.js library to explore and display microbiome data from the provided samples.json. The primary features of this application include:

Horizontal Bar Chart: Display the top 10 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) found in selected individuals from the dataset. This is achieved through a dynamic dropdown menu that allows the user to choose the individual whose microbiome data they wish to explore.

Bubble Chart: Visualize each sample from the dataset as points in a bubble chart, providing a comprehensive overview of the microbial composition in the samples.

Demographic Information Display: Present the metadata for each individual, including demographic details. This feature is designed to offer insights into the dataset beyond the microbial composition, facilitating a deeper understanding of the samples.

Dynamic Data Representation: Implement interactivity to enable users to select different samples from the dropdown menu and dynamically update the visualizations to reflect the selected individual's data.
